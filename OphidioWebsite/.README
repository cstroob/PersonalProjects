This is a website I am currently creating for an online reptile store front.
It has been my introduction to HTML, Javascript, and CSS. It is intended to
include online transaction capabilities for both livestock and hardware.

This site will be backed by an SQL database that coordinates purchases and
product deliveries. This database will also keep the site regularly up to
date with inventory amounts and pricing.
